# Product Philosophy

## Non-negotiable Principles
- We do not sell images; we sell the experience of observing change over time.
- Completion is user-defined.
- Progress happens only on explicit user action.
- Irreversibility is intentional.
- Slowness is a feature.
- Determinism is preferred over randomness.
- Storage minimization is a product constraint.
